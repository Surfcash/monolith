# Monolith configuration

# FIRST TIME SETUP

# configured all Monolith plugins running on your server and
# signal that the plugin can start.

# If LOCAL you are required to configure all of the Monolith
# plugins via their respective config.yml files in their data
# folders on the server.
# If GITHUB you are required to host all (except for this one)
# of the Monolith plugin configuration files on a publicly
# accessible GitHub repository. Run your server with the
# firstTimeSetup flag above set to true to obtain a copy of
# the default config.yml files and then move them over.
